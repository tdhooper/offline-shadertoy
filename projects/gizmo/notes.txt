in code, we pick a place we want a gizmo to transform a 3d position

picking any point might not be transformed by the gizmo - as it might be inside a branch

try this

1. render a low-res viewpoort, with depth
2. apply a transformation
3. find changed pixels
4. pick a changed pixel
5. use depth to project into 3d


we want to build a basis matrix for this gizmo

we want to find the origin relative to the gizmo

find the origin through gradient descent... pick points around the starting point, run them through the function, and see which direction is closer to the origin.. move our starting point in that direction, repeat

to find the axes, do the same but for the local unit coordinates (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)

this will give us 4 points in world space
